    description="[h1][b] Bags Of Many [/b][/h1]

A mod that adds different bags you can find in the world of Noita allowing you to carry more of you wizard stuff by expanding your available inventory space.

To pickup items in the bags you need to hold it in your hands then use your [b]KICK[/b] action near an object you want to pick up. The items you can pick up depends on the type of bag.

To drop items you use the inventory ui that appears when you open you inventory and [b]CLICK[/b] on the object you want to drop.

I wanted to add an option for more inventory space that more closely fits the theme of the game and is more balanced.

[h2] Items [/h2]
Three types of bags exist:
[list]
 [*] Universal
 [*] Binder
 [*] Pouch
[/list]
The universal bag allows you to carry wands, potions and spells.
The spell binder allows you to carry spells.
The potion pouch allows you to carry potions.

Three sizes exist by type of bags:
[list]
 [*] Small
 [*] Medium
 [*] Big
[/list]
Each of these size give a progressively larger inventory space. The space is dependant on the type of bags you are using and so is the inventory size increase.
