A mod that adds different bags you can find in the world of Noita allowing you to carry more of you wizard stuff by expanding your available inventory space.

[b] POTION ALCHEMY TABLE now available in potion pouches and universal bags (setting need to be turned on).
- Click the small icon to the left of the potion or universal bag gui button.
- Materials in potions wont react together except if you are on the beta branch since it's a new feature there.[/b]

Better inventory dragging now available you can now move items between bags if you allowed bag inception.

To pickup items in the bags you need to hold it in your hands then use your [b]KICK[/b] action near an object you want to pick up. The items you can pick up depends on the type of bag.

To drop items you use the inventory ui that appears when you open you inventory and [b]CLICK[/b] on the object you want to drop.
If you have enabled inventory dragging you can also throw items by dragging them vanilla style.

I wanted to add an option for more inventory space that more closely fits the theme of the game and is more balanced.

[b] Checkout the mod settings there is a lot of options to tailor the mod to your liking, LIKE A LOT OF SETTINGS [/b]

Each of these size give a progressively larger inventory space. The space is dependant on the type of bags you are using and so is the inventory size increase.
