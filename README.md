# Bags of Many

This mod add bags in Noita as items that can be found and allow you to carry more of your wizard stuff! They occupy one of your item slot and will retain their inventory when thrown.

To use the bags you need to hold it in your hands then use your kick action near an object you want to pick up. The items you can pick up depends on the type of bag.

I wanted to add an option for more inventory space that more closely fits the theme of the game and is more balanced.

### Items

Three types of bags exist:
    - Universal <img src="files/ui_gfx/bag_universal_small.png">
    - Binders <img src="files/ui_gfx/bag_spells_small.png">
    - Potions <img src="files/ui_gfx/bag_potions_small.png">

Universal bags allow you to carry by default: wand, potions and spells.
Spell Binders allow you to carry spells.
Potion Pouches allow you to carry potions.

Three types of bag size exist by type:
    - Small <img src="files/ui_gfx/bag_universal_small.png">
    - Medium <img src="files/ui_gfx/bag_universal_medium.png">
    - Big <img src="files/ui_gfx/bag_universal_big.png">

Each of these size give a progressively larger inventory space. The space is dependant on the type of bags you are using and so is the inventory size increase.

By default these are the stats for each bags and tiers:
|   |  Universal <img src="files/ui_gfx/bag_universal_small.png"> | Binders <img src="files/ui_gfx/bag_spells_small.png"> | Potions <img style="top:10px" src="files/ui_gfx/bag_potions_small.png"> |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Small** | 3 | 5 | 2 |
| **Medium** | 5 |  7 | 3 |
| **Big** | 8 | 10 | 5 |
